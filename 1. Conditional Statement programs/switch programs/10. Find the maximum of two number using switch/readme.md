# Program to find maximum of two numbers using switch

## Description
The program takes two integers as input.
The condition num1 > num2 evaluates to 1 (true) or 0 (false).
The switch statement checks the result:
- If 1, num1 is assigned to max.
- If 0, num2 is assigned to max.
Finally, the maximum number is printed.
This approach demonstrates how to use a switch case for decision-making, even though it's more commonly used for discrete values.
