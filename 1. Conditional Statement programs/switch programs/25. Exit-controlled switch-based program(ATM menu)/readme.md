# Exit-controlled switch-based program (ATM menu)

## Author

## Description
This is a simple menu-driven C program using a switch statement to simulate an ATM menu.
It includes options for deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, and exiting the program. 
The program uses an exit-controlled loop (do-while) to ensure the menu is displayed at least once.
This program is simple, user-friendly, and demonstrates the use of switch and do-while effectively.

## How it works
Menu Display: The menu is displayed inside a do-while loop to ensure it runs at least once.
Switch-Case: Each menu option is handled using a switch statement.
Exit-Controlled Loop: The loop continues until the user selects option 4 (Exit).
Validation: Input validation ensures deposits and withdrawals are positive, and withdrawals do not exceed the balance.
