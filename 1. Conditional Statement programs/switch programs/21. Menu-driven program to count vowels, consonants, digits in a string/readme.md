## Description
This is a simple menu-driven C program that analyzes a user-entered string and counts:
- Vowels
- Consonants
- Digits
It uses:
- A string.h library functions
- A switch-case menu for choosing what to display
- The program continues until the user selects Exit.


## Features


## How it works
The user enters a full string (including spaces) using: (fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);
).
Before showing the menu, the program loops through the string and counts:
- Digits
- Vowels
- Consonants
Using simple ASCII comparisons.
then it will calculates no fo vowels, consonants and digits are in the string.
Looping: The menu appears repeatedly until the user selects 4 (Exit).
