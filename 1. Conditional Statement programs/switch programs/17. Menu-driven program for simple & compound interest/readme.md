# Menu-driven program for simple and compound interest

## Author

## Description
This is a menu-driven C program using a switch statement to calculate Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI).
This program is user-friendly and demonstrates the use of a menu-driven approach with a switch statement effectively.

## How it works
The program displays a menu with three options:
- Option 1: Calculate Simple Interest using the formula: SI=100P⋅R⋅T​.
- Option 2: Calculate Compound Interest using the formula: CI=P⋅(1+100R​)T−P.
- Option 3: Exit the program.
The user inputs their choice, and the program performs the corresponding calculation.
The program loops until the user selects the "Exit" option.
