# Simple calculator program using switch

## Author
Prakash Singh

## Description
This program takes two operands and an operator from the user, performs the specified operation, and prints the result using a switch statement.
(Ensure valid input for numbers and operations).

## How it works
The program uses scanf to take two integers and a character (operator) as input.
The switch statement evaluates the operator and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
For division, it checks if the denominator is zero to avoid runtime errors.
If an invalid operator is entered, it displays an error message and exits.
