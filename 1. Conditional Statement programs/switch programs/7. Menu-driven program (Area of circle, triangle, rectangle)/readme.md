## Description
This is a Menu driven C-program using switch to find area of circle or triangle or rectangle.
This program is simple, user-friendly, and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## How it works
The program displays a menu with options to calculate the area of a circle, triangle, or rectangle.
The user selects an option by entering a number (1-4).
Based on the user's choice:
- For a circle, the program calculates the area using π*r*r.
- For a triangle, it uses 1/2*base*height.
- For a rectangle, it uses length*breadth.
The program continues until the user selects option 4 to exit.
