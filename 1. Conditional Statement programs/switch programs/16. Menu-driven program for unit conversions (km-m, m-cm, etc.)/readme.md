## Description
Here is a menu-driven C program using a switch statement for unit conversion (e.g., kilometers to meters, meters to centimeters, etc.)
It uses switch into do while loopfor unit conversion. 
This program is simple, user-friendly, and can be extended to include more unit conversions if needed!

## How it works
The program displays a menu with options for unit conversions.
The user selects an option by entering a number (1-4).
Based on the choice, the program performs the corresponding conversion using simple arithmetic.
The program loops until the user selects option 4 to exit.
