## Description
THis is a c program to find the maximum number among three numbers.

## How it works
The program uses nested switch statements to evaluate conditions.
The outer switch checks if num1 is greater than or equal to both num2 and num3.
If the condition is false, the inner switch checks if num2 is greater than or equal to both num1 and num3.
If neither of the above conditions is true, num3 is assigned as the maximum.
