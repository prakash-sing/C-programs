# Menu driven program for checking triangle type

## Author

## Description
This is a simple menu-driven C program using a switch statement to check the type of triangle based on its sides.
To check the type of triangle based on the lengths of its sides, this code follows these criteria:
Triangle Inequality Rule: The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. 
Types of Triangles:
- Equilateral Triangle: All three sides are equal. 
- Isosceles Triangle: Exactly two sides are equal. 
- Scalene Triangle: All three sides are different. 
This program is simple, user-friendly, and ensures proper validation of triangle sides.

## How it works
The program displays a menu with two options:
- Option 1: Check the type of triangle.
- Option 2: Exit the program.
If the user selects option 1, they are prompted to input the three sides of the triangle.
The program checks:
If the sides satisfy the triangle inequality rule.
If the triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene.
If the user selects option 2, the program exits gracefully.
For invalid inputs, an error message is displayed.
