Demonstrates loops and conditional statements
Useful for basic pattern printing practice

## How it works
First it display menu for printing options.
Inside an infinite loop (while(1)), the program displays a menu.
Then it takes inpuf from user: the user selects a pattern by entering a number between 1 and 4.
The value of choice determines which case in the switch statement runs.
The type of pattern printed(option 1-3) as the input enters options and no. of stars using accordingly.
If the user enters 4, the program prints a message and breaks out of the loop.
