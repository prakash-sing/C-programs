# C-program to print day of a week by number entering

## Author

## Description
This program takes a day number (1–7) as input and prints the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement. 
If the input is invalid, it displays an error message.

## How it works
The program prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 7.
The switch statement matches the input with cases for each day of the week.
If the input matches a valid case, it prints the corresponding day name.
If no match is found, the default case handles invalid inputs.
