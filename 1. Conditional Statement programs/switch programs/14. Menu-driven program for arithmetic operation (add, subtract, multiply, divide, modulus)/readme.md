# Arithmetic operations using switch

## Author
Prakash Singh

## Description
This is a C-program to do simple arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide and modulus) using switch.

## How it works
Menu loop runs until user selects 6 (Exit).
Takes two integers as input for each operation.
Handles division/modulus by zero safely.
Uses a switch-case for clarity.
