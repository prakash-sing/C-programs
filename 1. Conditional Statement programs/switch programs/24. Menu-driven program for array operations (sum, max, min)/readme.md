## Description
This is a simple menu-driven program in C using a switch statement to perform basic array operations (sum, maximum, and minimum).
This program is simple, beginner-friendly, and avoids using functions for clarity.

## How it works

Switch Statement: Handles the user's choice and performs the corresponding operation.
Loop: The program continues to display the menu until the user chooses to exit.
