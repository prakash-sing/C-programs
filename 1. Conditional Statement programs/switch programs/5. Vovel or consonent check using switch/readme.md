## Description
Simple C program to check whether a character is vovel or consonent using switch.
Groups all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in one set of cases.
All other alphabets fall into the default case (consonants).

## How it works
The program takes a character as input.
The switch statement checks if the character matches any of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u in both uppercase and lowercase).
If it matches, it prints that the character is a vowel.
If not, the default case will print that the character is a consonent.
Note: entered character must be an alphabet.
