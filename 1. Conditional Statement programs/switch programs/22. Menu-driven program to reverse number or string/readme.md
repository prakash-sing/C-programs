# Menu-driven program to reverse any number or a string

## Author

## Description
Here is a simple menu-driven C program using a switch statement to reverse either a number or a string without using any additional functions.

## How it works
Menu Options:
- Option 1: Reverse a number.
- Option 2: Reverse a string.
- 3rd: this one is a default value for invalid choice.
Case 1 (Reverse Number): The program uses a while loop to extract digits from the number and build the reversed number.
Case 2 (Reverse String): The program uses a for loop to reverse the string manually by iterating from the end to the beginning.
Default Case: Handles invalid input by displaying an error message.
This program avoids using any additional functions (like strrev or recursion) and performs the tasks manually.
