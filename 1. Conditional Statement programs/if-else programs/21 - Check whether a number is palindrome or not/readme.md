## Description
Simple user input(integer only) C-program to checking whether a number is palindrome or not.
A palindrome number is that which is same on reversing itself.

## How it works
First user enter a number/integer.
Then a second variable(original) store the original value of the number.
Now extract digits using modulus and build the reversed number.
At last compare both original and reversed number -
- If both are equal then the number is palindrome.
- If both are not equal then the number is not a palindrome.
