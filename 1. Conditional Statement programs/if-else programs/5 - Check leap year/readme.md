This C-program checks whether is it leap year or not.
This program applies the standard leap year rule and fulfill the criteria for being a leap year.

## Leap year rule
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or it is divisible by 400.
For example - the year 2000 and 1600 is a leap year, while 1900, 2100 and 1800 is not.

The program takes an integer input as a year and checks by this given leap year rule.
Based on the leap year's conditions, it prints whether the year is leap year or not.
