## Description 
This C program checks if given integer is divisible by 3 and 7 by using modulus operator to test the divisibility.

## Features
- Takes an integer input from the user.
- Checks the divisibility by both 3 and 7 using condition statement.
- Provides clear output messages for divisible and non-divisible cases.
- Simple structure ideal for beginners who is learning conditional logic.

## How it works
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The program uses the '%' (modulo) operator to compute the reminder of the integer (divided by both 3 and 7).
- If both reminders are zero, the number is divisible by 3 and 7.
- Appropriate messages are printed based on the result.
