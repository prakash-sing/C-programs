## Description
A simple and complete C program using if-else to calculate an electricity bill based on units consumed.
This example uses a slab-based rate system for this code -
- 0 – 50 units → ₹0.50 per unit
- 51 – 150 units → ₹0.75 per unit
- 151 – 250 units → ₹1.20 per unit
- Above 250 units → ₹1.50 per unit

## How it works
Input Validation: Ensures the user enters a valid non-negative number.
Slab Calculation: Uses if-else to determine which slab the units fall into and calculates accordingly.
Output: Displays the bill rounded to two decimal places.
