## Description
Simple C-program To determine if a given positive integer is a perfect square, we can use a simple iterative approach.
A perfect square is a number that is the square of an integer.

## How it works
The function iterates through integers starting from 0.
For each integer i, it calculates i * i and checks if it equals the input number num.
If a match is found, the function returns true. Otherwise, it continues until i * i > num.
