## Description
The program takes two numbers as inputs from the user and determines which one is large.
It demonstrates the use of basic input/output functions and conditional statement(if-else) in C-programming.

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter two integers.
- Compares the two numbers to find the large.
- Displays which number is large or both are equal.
- Simple logic suitable for beginners.

## How it works
- The program asks the user to enter two numbers as input.
- Uses 'if-else' statements to compare the numbers:
 - If first number is greater than second number, then it prints that number is large.
 - If second number is large then it prints second is large.
 - If both numbers are equal, it prints both are equal.
