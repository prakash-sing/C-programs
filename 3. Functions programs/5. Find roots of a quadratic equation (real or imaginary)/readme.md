# Find the roots of a quadratic equation (Real or imaginary)

## Author
Prakash Singh

## Description
This is a C program that calculates and displays the roots based on the discriminant.


# How it works
Input Coefficients: The program accepts values for a, b, and c.
Discriminant Calculation: The discriminant is calculated as b² - 4ac. If discriminant > 0: Roots are real and distinct. If discriminant == 0: Roots are real and equal. If discriminant < 0: Roots are complex.
Output Results: Based on the discriminant value, the program computes and displays the roots.
