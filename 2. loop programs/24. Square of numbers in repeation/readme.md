## Description
I used the function 'fflush()', it removes or 'flush out' any data remaining in the buffer. 
The argument to 'fflush()' must be buffer which we want to flush out.
Here i used 'stdin', which means buffer related with standard input device, i.e., keyboard.

## How it works
First it print for user to input.
Then it calculate and print its square.
Finally in repetion it prints an appropriate message to repeat the program.
Then if we enter appropriate message for repeatition then it repeat the program.
