## Discription
This is a simple logic bulilding program to print numbers from 10 to 1 using loops.
The while loop checks the condition (number >= 1) before each iteration.
The counter variable number is decremented inside the loop to avoid an infinite loop.
This approach ensures that numbers are printed in descending order from 10 to 1.
