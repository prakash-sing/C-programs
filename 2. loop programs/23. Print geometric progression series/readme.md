## Author

## Description
This is a C-program to print the geometric progression series upto N number of terms.
A Geometric Progression (GP) is a sequence where each term is derived by multiplying the previous term by a fixed common ratio. 
This program is about top print the first n terms of a GP given the first term (a), common ratio (r), and number of terms (n).
## How it works
Inputs:
- First term a
- Common ratio r
- Number of terms n
Loop: Starts from a and multiplies by r each time.
No extra functions: Everything is inside main. Uses long long to avoid overflow for moderately large values.
