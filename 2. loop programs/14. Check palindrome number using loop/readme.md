## Discription
This is a program to check whether a number is palindrome or not.
This code is in three steps:
- Store Original Value – Keep the original number for comparison.
- Reverse Digits – Extract digits using modulus and build the reversed number.
-  Compare – If reversed equals original, it’s a palindrome.
