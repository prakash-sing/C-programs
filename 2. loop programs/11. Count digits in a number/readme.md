## Discription
This is a code for counting digits in a number using for loop.
Input Handling: The program reads an integer from the user.
Special Case: If the input is 0, it directly sets digitCount to 1 since 0 has one digit.
For Loop: The loop iterates while num is not zero: In each iteration, it removes the last digit by dividing num by 10. The counter digitCount increments with each iteration.
Output: After the loop ends, the total count of digits is printed.
