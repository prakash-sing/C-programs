# Print arithematic progression series

## Author

## Description
This is a C program to print an Arithmetic Progression (AP) series for given first term, common difference, and number of terms.
It includes input validation and handles edge cases.
An Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
In C, we can easily generate an AP series and calculate its sum using either a mathematical formula or iterative loops.

## How it works
Inputs:
- firstTerm → The first number in the AP.
- commonDiff → The fixed difference between consecutive terms.
- numTerms → How many terms to print.
Formula for the ith term: Ti =a+(i−1)⋅d where:
- a = first term
- d = common difference
Validation: Ensures all inputs are integers and number of terms is positive.
Output: Prints the AP series separated by spaces.
