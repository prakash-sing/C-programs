# Generate and print all the possible combination of 123

## Author

## Discription
This is a simple and complete C program to generate all possible combinations of 1, 2, and 3 using nested loops.
This will include repetitions (e.g., 1 1 1, 1 1 2, etc.).

## How it works:
Outer loop (i) → Picks the first number (1 to 3).
Middle loop (j) → Picks the second number (1 to 3).
Inner loop (k) → Picks the third number (1 to 3).
Each combination is printed immediately.
